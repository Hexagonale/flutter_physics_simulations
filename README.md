# physics

Free time project with physics simulations written completely in Flutter.

## Before You explore

Because of the hobby nature of this project, most simulations are on separate branches
(waiting to be finished up). If You want to explore more You should definitely check
other branches.

## Project structure

At the hearth of the project os the flexible
[Runge Kutta][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/runge%e2%80%93kutta_methods]
ODE solver (integrator). It is highly flexible and just requires the table of
coefficients in form of the Butcher tableau. This allows You to set up different
orders of explicit RK algorithm easily.

This project, as well as, its readme are under development. The project is never going
to be finished or released in any form. This is more of a bucket for ideas somewhat
related to physics simulations.
